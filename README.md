# Question 1
There is a Ben and Jerry's ice cream machine at UTown that charges $1 to play. Given that the price of a small tub is around $6, what is the distribution that best models the expected number of tries before successfully grabbing one of the tubs and how would you derive and compute the parameter(s) for this distribution from actual data? Bonus points for you if you try this in person and provide a GitHub repository to show case your work.

## Answer
We are interested in modelling the number of tries before success. Each tries can be simplified to 2 outcomes. Success(get the ice cream) and failure (Do not get the ice cream). Therefore a geometric distribution is appropriate to model what we want. 
Refer to the python file attached for a rough attempt at modelling.

# Question 2
m&m candies are manufactured at two different plants in the US with the following color distribution
Cleveland : Red=0.131, Orange=0.205, Yellow=0.135, Green=0.198, Blue=0.207, and Brown=0.124.
Hackettstown : Red=0.125, Orange=0.25, Yellow=0.125, Green=0.125, Blue=0.25, and Brown=0.125.
Suppose you bought many packets of m&m, how can you determine which plant these packets came with statistical testing?
Bonus: The methodology in this article is flawed. Can you explain why?
